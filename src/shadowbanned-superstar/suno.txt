[Intro – snarl + amp buzz]
[guitar feedback]
Yeah, they said I’m done?
Then why the fuck you still talkin’?
RJ’s still breathin’.
Let’s go.
[drum crash → bass drop]

⸻

[Verse 1 – fast spit + grime riff]
Shadowbanned, my ass, I’m still in your feed,
You refresh once — I plant a seed.
You flag my art ’cause it gets you tight,
You ain’t righteous — you’re just scared I bite.

Creep my page, screenshot my face,
Beg for a spark while you hide your place.
You pray for my fall, I pray you scroll,
But God don’t bless a jealous soul.

⸻

[Pre-Chorus – low growl + echo vox]
You can’t cancel charisma, bitch,
You can’t ghost what don’t glitch.
I’m the line you’ll never reach,
RJ preach — middle-finger speech.

⸻

[Chorus – screamed + gang vox]
Shadowbanned superstar, kiss my scars,
They built me bars, I broke their bars.
Fake-ass saints with your tattletale hearts,
Keep my name in your mouth — that’s free PR.

Shadowbanned superstar, you lit the match,
Now watch me laugh as your fences catch.
One shot, one life, one last chance —
RJ’s vengeance, fuck your stance.

⸻

[Verse 2 – angrier, dirtier flow]
You DM sweet, then snitch next day,
Two-faced snakes got a choir to play.
Report this, block that, call it “safe zone,”
I build kingdoms from your damn stones.

You cry “community” — nah, it’s a cult,
Jealous ass punks, yeah, that’s the result.
You want clean feeds? I want war,
RJ’s blood in the algorithm core.

⸻

[Bridge – spoken + feedback wall]
[beat drop → silence → whisper]
They shadow me? Good.
Now I hunt unseen.
[distorted whisper]
Every ban just builds my machine.
[shouted]
You had one shot —
You wasted it on me.

⸻

[Final Chorus – massive layered hook]
Shadowbanned superstar, born for the hate,
I eat your rumors, I clean my plate.
You swing first, I detonate —
RJ rises — check the gate.

Shadowbanned superstar, no brakes, no mask,
You talk shit, I outlast.
One chance, one spark, one blast —
RJ’s roar — fade to black.

⸻

[Outro – fade with distortion + breath]
[guitar scream]
Say my name again.
I dare you.
RJ… out.
[bass hum → cut]
