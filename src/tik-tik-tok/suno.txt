[Intro – whispered tease]
(tick… tick… tock…) [breath in]
You want time? [pause 0.5s]
Then earn it. [bass rumble → drop]

⸻

[Verse 1 – fast whisper flow]
Tick tick tock — I’m the sin you chase, [hi-hat tap]
Lip gloss poison, cherry-lace. [bass pulse]
Say my name with a guilty face, [breath hit]
I move slow — but I set the pace. [bass drop]

Back it up — clock rewind, [snap]
You lose count when I cross that line. [beat pause]
Every word’s a little crime, [bass growl]
Baby, love’s a pantomime. [breath exhale]

Breath on your neck like one, two, three, [hi-hat rise]
Can’t keep time when you’re under me. [bass hit]
Whispers curl like ecstasy, [snap]
Tick tick tock — now you’re history. [bass drop]

⸻

[Pre-Chorus – breathy bounce]
Tick tick — I bite, I tease, [whisper trail]
Tock tock — drop to your knees. [bass pulse]
Each breath’s a freeze, release, [breath hold]
Play my game — say please. [bass slam]

⸻

[Chorus – hard whisper-rap / bass heavy]
Tick tick tock — your heart can’t cope, [bass slam]
Every move I make’s a trope. [snap]
Tick tick tock — you lose all hope, [bass pulse]
Wrapped in silk — I pull that rope. [bass drop]

Tick tick tock — I’m your favorite sin, [hi-hat flurry]
Clock hands tremble on my skin. [bass growl]
Tick tick tock — I pull you in, [breath hit]
Now count again — begin, begin. [bass drop]

⸻

[Verse 2 – faster, flirty tone]
Eyes like clocks — they spin too wild, [snap]
I smile sweet — you turn defiled. [bass rumble]
Say “no” twice but mean “stay a while,” [breath laugh]
Every line’s got a wicked style. [bass hit]

Hands like thieves — they steal my time, [bass pulse]
You’re the reason I lose my rhyme. [beat pause]
Body language — pantomime, [whisper glide]
Your breath’s the bass — your sin’s the chime. [bass drop]

Under my spell — you chase the cue, [hi-hat roll]
Tick tick tick — déjà vu. [bass hit]
I’m the second hand that’s breaking through, [snap]
Baby, time bends just for you. [bass drop]

⸻

[Bridge – slow seductive whisper / bass mute]
(tick… tick… tock…) [metronome clicks]
Stop pretending you’re innocent. [breath in]
We both know what the night meant. [beat pause]
Time’s a circle — and we’re spent. [bass drop returns slowly]

⸻

[Verse 3 – rapid whisper-flow / club energy]
Tick tick tick — I play, I break, [bass kick]
Hearts on rhythm, bodies quake. [hi-hat snap]
Lips say “mine,” hips say “take,” [breath hit]
You’re the wound I wanna make. [bass slam]

Snap that beat — I twist your fate, [snap]
Whispers sound like love and hate. [bass pulse]
Drip that sweat — it’s getting late, [bass growl]
Tick tick tock — you’ll never wait. [bass drop]

Candle wax — shattered glass, [beat pause]
Counting seconds as they pass. [breath sigh]
Every tick’s a sly trespass, [bass pulse]
Time’s a lover built to last. [bass slam]

⸻

[Final Chorus – layered whispers / distorted bass]
Tick tick tock — the clock’s on fire, [bass slam]
Say my name till you expire. [echo tick tick tock]
Tick tick tock — no hearts retire, [bass roll]
Every breath builds something higher. [bass drop]

Tick tick tock — your pulse the game, [bass growl]
Whisper mine — it’s all the same. [hi-hat flurry]
Tick tick tock — you crave the flame, [bass slam]
Now tell me, baby — what’s my name? [reverb fade → breath out]

(tick… tick… tock…) [fade out to bass throb and breathy hums]
