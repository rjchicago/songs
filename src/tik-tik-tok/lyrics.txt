You want time?
Then earn it.

Tick tick tock — I'm the sin you chase,
Lip gloss poison, cherry-lace.
Say my name with a guilty face,
I move slow — but I set the pace.

Back it up — clock rewind,
You lose count when I cross that line.
Every word's a little crime,
Baby, love's a pantomime.

Breath on your neck like one, two, three,
Can't keep time when you're under me.
Whispers curl like ecstasy,
Tick tick tock — now you're history.

Tick tick — I bite, I tease,
Tock tock — drop to your knees.
Each breath's a freeze, release,
Play my game — say please.

Tick tick tock — your heart can't cope,
Every move I make's a trope.
Tick tick tock — you lose all hope,
Wrapped in silk — I pull that rope.

Tick tick tock — I'm your favorite sin,
Clock hands tremble on my skin.
Tick tick tock — I pull you in,
Now count again — begin, begin.

Eyes like clocks — they spin too wild,
I smile sweet — you turn defiled.
Say "no" twice but mean "stay a while,"
Every line's got a wicked style.

Hands like thieves — they steal my time,
You're the reason I lose my rhyme.
Body language — pantomime,
Your breath's the bass — your sin's the chime.

Under my spell — you chase the cue,
Tick tick tick — déjà vu.
I'm the second hand that's breaking through,
Baby, time bends just for you.

Stop pretending you're innocent.
We both know what the night meant.
Time's a circle — and we're spent.

Tick tick tick — I play, I break,
Hearts on rhythm, bodies quake.
Lips say "mine," hips say "take,"
You're the wound I wanna make.

Snap that beat — I twist your fate,
Whispers sound like love and hate.
Drip that sweat — it's getting late,
Tick tick tock — you'll never wait.

Candle wax — shattered glass,
Counting seconds as they pass.
Every tick's a sly trespass,
Time's a lover built to last.

Tick tick tock — the clock's on fire,
Say my name till you expire.
Tick tick tock — no hearts retire,
Every breath builds something higher.

Tick tick tock — your pulse the game,
Whisper mine — it's all the same.
Tick tick tock — you crave the flame,
Now tell me, baby — what's my name?
