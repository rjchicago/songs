Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey
Don't want you, need you, yeah, I need you to fill me up
마시고 마셔 봐도, 성에 차지 않아
Got a feelin' that, oh, yeah (yeah), you could be everything that
That I need (need), taste so sweet (sweet), every sip makes me want more, yeah
Lookin' like snacks 'cause you got it like that (whoo)
Take a big bite, want another bite, yeah
너의 모든 걸 난 원해, 원해, 원해
너 말곤 모두 뻔해, 뻔해, 뻔해
When you're in my arms, I hold you so tight, so tight
Can't let go, no, no, not tonight
지금 당장 날 봐, 시간 없잖아
넌 내꺼야, 이미 알고 있잖아
'Cause I need you to need me
I'm empty, you feed me, so refreshin'
My little soda pop
You're all I can think of, every drop I drink up
You're my soda pop, my little soda pop
Cool me down, you're so hot, pour me up, I won't stop
You're my soda pop, my little soda pop
My little soda pop
Uh, make me wanna flip the top, 한 모금에 you hit the spot
Every little drip and drop, fizz and pop, ah, 소름 돋아, it's gettin' hot (whoo)
Yes, I'm sippin' when it's drippin' now, it's done? I need a second round
And pour a lot, and don't you stop 'til my soda pop fizzles out
꿈 속에 그려왔던 너
난 절대 놓칠 수 없어
널 원해 꼭, I waited so long for a taste of soda
So, the wait is over, baby
Come and fill me up (just can't get enough, oh)
You're all I can think of, every drop I drink up
You're my soda pop, my little soda pop (yeah, yeah)
Cool me down, you're so hot, pour me up, I won't stop (oh, oh)
You're my soda pop, my little soda pop
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You're my soda pop, gotta drink every drop
