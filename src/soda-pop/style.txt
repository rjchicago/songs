A dark, grungy punk track driven by distorted guitars, fuzzy bass, and 
industrial percussion. The vocals are soft, whispering, and intimate — 
building tension with breathy vulnerability before exploding into raw 
emotion. The energy is rebellious and chaotic, blending analog distortion 
and digital grit. Think underground warehouse vibes — metallic echoes, 
overdriven synths, pulsing feedback, and a defiant edge that feels both 
fragile and feral. The sound should oscillate between quiet intensity and 
full-throttle distortion, creating a contrast between restraint and release.
