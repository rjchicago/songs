He wore a thrift-store tie, the color of the sky,
Said, "Meet me by the bleachers, don't be shy."
We talked about our favorite bands,
Hands brushing close, too scared to stand.
Your hoodie smelled like ocean air,
We laughed at how we didn't care.

Polaroids and paper hearts,
We thought the world would never start.
Every song was ours to play,
Until the night we drove away—

So dance with me before the summer ends,
Under fading lights with our closest friends.
Say you'll write, say you'll pretend—
That nothing's changing,
That this won't end.
Oh, dance with me before the summer ends.

College letters, maps, and pins,
We traced our futures on our skin.
I kept your mixtape in my car,
Still skip that song, it breaks my heart.
The sunset turned our shadows long,
We swore we'd meet where we belong.

You said, "Maybe love's not meant to stay,
But we had our stars, our perfect day."
And if you ever hear this song,
You'll know it's where we both belong.

So dance with me before the summer ends,
Under fading lights with our closest friends.
Promise me we'll meet again—
Somewhere softer,
Past the bend.
Oh, dance with me before the summer ends.

Leaves will fall, and you'll forget,
But I'll remember how we met.
