White wedding… 
White wedding…
Do you take this sin… to be divine?

Lace on skin, confession tight,
Veil half-off in electric light.
Holy ghost between my thighs,
You say amen — I roll my eyes.

Pledge your tongue, I'll bless the crime,
Body clock off, we're out of time.
Every vow a little lie,
Say forever while we sigh.

Bells are moaning, wrists entwined,
Candle wax, your pulse on mine.
Faith is friction, love's the line.
WHITE WEDDING! WHITE WEDDING!

White wedding!
Kiss me clean, then make it dirty.
White wedding!
Saints get loud, the holy's flirty.
White wedding!
Lace and leather, sweat and sin.
White wedding!
Say your prayers — then slide back in.

You preach control — I taste the proof.
My altar hums beneath the roof.
Call it love, but don't say grace,
Halo slips, I like that face.

White wedding… white wedding…
Holy heat, come baptize me…
Bless this lust, it's liturgy…
It's a nice day for a white wedding!

White wedding!
Bodies crash like sacred wine.
White wedding!
You're the sermon, I'm the sign.
White wedding!
Every breath a sweet offense.
White wedding!
Pure temptation, consequence.

White wedding… 
White wedding…
