[Genre: Industrial Techno / Electro-Punk]
[Tempo: 110 BPM]
[Style: Berlin warehouse sound, distorted synths, mechanical percussion, sultry female duet vocals]
[Energy: Aggressive + Hypnotic]

Vibe:
Hard-hitting Berlin industrial techno — pulsing, distorted, hypnotic. A blend of raw electronic aggression and ritual sensuality. Think pounding 4/4 kicks at 108–112 BPM, with deep metallic basslines, echoing claps, and white-noise risers that mimic hissing steam or whispered breaths.

Instrumentation & Production:
	•	Heavy side-chained synth bass and kick, distorted to near-clipping.
	•	Mechanical percussion — metallic hits, pneumatic bursts, reverb-drenched snares.
	•	Layered analog synths and modular distortion effects, swirling in stereo.
	•	Glitchy reverse samples and breathy vocal chops used rhythmically.
	•	Occasional breakdowns that feel like a factory going silent before roaring back.

Vocals:
	•	Alternating female duet:
