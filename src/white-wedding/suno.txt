[Genre: Industrial Techno / Electro-Punk]
[Tempo: 110 BPM]
[Vocals: Female duet – one sultry whisper, one gritty distortion]

⸻

[Intro – slow tease]
(bells ring – warped and echoing)
[breath in → bass pulse]
white wedding… white wedding…
(whisper) Do you take this sin… to be divine?
[bass drop → rhythm hit]

⸻

[Verse 1 – whisper rap]
Lace on skin, confession tight,
Veil half-off in electric light.
Holy ghost between my thighs,
You say amen — I roll my eyes.

Pledge your tongue, I’ll bless the crime,
Body clock off, we’re out of time.
Every vow a little lie,
Say forever while we sigh.

⸻

[Pre-Chorus – duet build]
(whisper) Bells are moaning, wrists entwined,
(growl) Candle wax, your pulse on mine.
(whisper) Faith is friction, love’s the line.
(distorted) WHITE WEDDING! WHITE WEDDING!

⸻

[Chorus – chant & tease]
White wedding!
Kiss me clean, then make it dirty.
White wedding!
Saints get loud, the holy’s flirty.
White wedding!
Lace and leather, sweat and sin.
White wedding!
Say your prayers — then slide back in.

⸻

[Verse 2 – playful exchange]
(sultry) You preach control — I taste the proof.
(gritty) My altar hums beneath the roof.
(sultry) Call it love, but don’t say grace,
(gritty) Halo slips, I like that face.

⸻

[Bridge – ritual build]
[bells distorted → bass surge]
(whisper chant) white wedding… white wedding…
(half-moan) holy heat, come baptize me…
(synths grinding) bless this lust, it’s liturgy…
It’s a nice day for a white wedding!

⸻

[Final Chorus – climax]
White wedding!
Bodies crash like sacred wine.
White wedding!
You’re the sermon, I’m the sign.
White wedding!
Every breath a sweet offence.
White wedding!
Pure temptation, consequence.

⸻

[Outro – slow bells & breath echoes]
(whispered duet)
white wedding… white wedding…
(soft laughter fading)
