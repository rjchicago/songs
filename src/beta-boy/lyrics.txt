"Plug him in, babe."

He's got a joystick heart and a floppy-disk grin,
Thinks he's cool in his neon skin.
Spandex dreams and a Walkman soul,
Thinks he's Bowie, stuck in a role.
Cassette rewind — love on delay,
He's got Pac-Man eyes, they give him away.
Mirror shades, even at night,
Still thinks he's living Miami Vice.

Oh, dial-up darling, hang up the line
Your 56-K and way past prime.

Beta Boy! dancing in a digital dream,
Retro rebel with a laser-beam scream.
Plug it in, babe — blow the fuse,
Love's a game, and you always lose.

Arcade swagger, leather and chrome,
Fax-machine feelings — nobody's home.
Rubik's-cube mind, scrambled and bright,
Swears he's McFly, but can't take flight.
Beta-max blues, Atari nights,
Still writes love notes in pixel lights.
Velcro shoes and hairspray pride,
Still thinks the spotlight's on his side.

Power-glove touch, static spark,
He's chasing ghosts in the technopark.
He's rebooting love, but babe — too late,
I'm a millennium queen, you're out of date.

Beta Boy! caught in an analog spin,
Still pressing play — can't log in.
Pull the plug, babe, break the cord,
You're my favorite obsolete reward.

Game over, darling — your princess is in another castle.
