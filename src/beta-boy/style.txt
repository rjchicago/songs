Up-tempo modern punk-pop anthem with playful female vocals and confident, flirty attitude. Mix punchy distorted guitars with crisp pop production, deep bass groove, and bright synth accents.

Vocals are seductive, teasing, and full of personality, alternating between smooth talk-singing and catchy melodic hooks. Backups are flirty and fun, echoing key phrases with giggles, whispers, and tight harmonies.

Production blends modern alt-pop polish with punk energy — think driving beat, crisp snare, layered chorus vocals, and a playful “wink” in the mix.

Mood: fun, sexy, confident, rebellious.
Tempo: ≈150–155 BPM
Tone: glossy, fast, flirtatious, and contagious.
